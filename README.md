---

## Data Preparation

1. **Organize Dataset:** Place images in `dataset/<class_name>/` directories (e.g., `dataset/recyclable/`, `dataset/non_recyclable/`).
2. **Run Preprocessing:**

   ```bash
   python data_preprocessing.py
   ```
3. **Inspect Augmentations:** The script visualizes sample augmentations to verify correctness.

---

## Model Training

1. **Configure Hyperparameters:** Modify constants in `model_training.py` (e.g., `IMG_HEIGHT`, `BATCH_SIZE`, `EPOCHS`).
2. **Train Model on Kaggle/Colab:**

   * Upload scripts and dataset to Colab.
   * Enable GPU runtime.
   * Run:

     ```bash
     python model_training.py
     ```
3. **Best Model:** Training checkpoints and the best-performing model will be saved as `best_model.h5`.

---

## Inference Pipeline

Use `inference.py` to load the trained model and classify new images:

```bash
python inference.py --image path_to_image.jpg
```

This script outputs the predicted class and confidence score. Integrate with the factory camera feed for real-time classification.

---

## Streamlit Dashboard

Launch the interactive dashboard to upload images and visualize predictions:

```bash
streamlit run dashboard.py
```

Features:

* Image uploader
* Real-time classification display
* Confidence visualization

---

## Advanced Data Processing with DeepSeek

If you have access to DeepSeek:

```bash
python deep_insights.py --csv production_data.csv
```

This generates a comprehensive report on throughput, waste metrics, and optimization suggestions.

---

## Testing and Optimization

* **Local Testing:** Validate the inference pipeline with sample images.
* **Fine-Tuning:** Unfreeze top layers of EfficientNet for additional training.
* **Quantization:** Use TensorFlow Lite for edge deployment.
* **Batch Processing:** Optimize throughput by processing images in batches or asynchronously.

---

## Deployment

* **REST API (Optional):** Wrap inference in FastAPI:

  ```bash
  uvicorn api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
  ```
* **Docker:** Containerize the app for scalable deployment.
* **Cloud Services:** Deploy on AWS EC2, GCP Compute Engine, or Azure VM.
